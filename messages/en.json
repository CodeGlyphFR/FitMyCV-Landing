  "FAQ": {
    "title": "Frequently\nasked questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Will AI replace my content?",
        "answer": "No. The AI does not fabricate skills or experiences. It works exclusively from the information you provide: it rephrases, reorganizes, and optimizes content with ATS formatting in mind. The review mode lets you validate each change, and the online editor gives you full control over the final result."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my resume be ATS-compatible?",
        "answer": "Yes. The resume structure, keyword selection, and section hierarchy are designed to be correctly parsed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). When your profile warrants it, the AI incorporates relevant terms from the job posting to strengthen the match with recruiter filters."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data protected?",
        "answer": "Your resumes and personal data are encrypted and never shared with third parties or used to train AI models. You can delete your account and all your data at any time. FitMyCV complies with GDPR."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a free trial?",
        "answer": "Yes. You receive 15 free credits when you create your account, with no credit card required. This lets you generate multiple resumes and test all features before purchasing additional credits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which job platforms are supported?",
        "answer": "FitMyCV works with any publicly accessible job posting that doesn't require authentication: Indeed, Welcome to the Jungle, France Travail, and many other platforms. Just paste the job URL. For sites requiring login (LinkedIn, etc.), a browser extension is under development — it will let you generate a resume directly from the job page, using the source resume of your choice."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is FitMyCV different from ChatGPT?",
        "answer": "If you ask ChatGPT to tailor your resume to a job posting, it will often make things up: a skill you don't have, a task you never performed, just to match the role. You notice it when proofreading — or worse, during an interview. Then you have to fix it, re-prompt, re-check… for every single application. FitMyCV works exclusively from your actual background and shows you every change before validation. The result: a faithful, optimized resume ready to send — in minutes, not hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "What formats are supported?",
        "answer": "You can import an existing resume as a PDF via drag and drop. After generation or editing, export is available in PDF and Word (.docx), ready to be attached to an application or uploaded to a job platform."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many resumes can I create?",
        "answer": "There is no limit. Each resume generation consumes credits. Upon registration, you receive 15 free credits to try the tool. After that, you purchase credits on demand based on your needs — no subscription, no commitment."
      },
      {
        "question": "In how many languages can I create my resume?",
        "answer": "The interface and resume translation are currently available in 4 languages: French, English, Spanish, and German. More languages will be added progressively. You can translate an existing resume into another language with one click, preserving the layout and content."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I edit my resume after generation?",
        "answer": "Yes. The online editor lets you modify each section directly in the browser. The review mode displays AI suggestions as proposals that you can accept or reject individually before finalizing your resume."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the match score?",
        "answer": "It is a percentage indicator that measures the fit between your resume and a job posting. The algorithm compares your profile's skills, experience, and keywords against the position's requirements. Along with the score, targeted recommendations tell you how to improve the match."
